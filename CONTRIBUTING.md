# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute, I really appreciate the help!

Let's keep this short and dive right in.

## Issues

Please open an issue for any bug, question, or feature request you might have.
Issues are always welcome and never a mistake (they can easily be renamed or closed).

If there are issue templates in the repository you are contributing to, you will most likely
find some more guidance about what to put in there.

## Pull-requests

*YES! But please open an issue first!*

Pull-requests are always welcome, but they might be redundant with (or superseded by) some work I'm currently doing on
 the project.
 
If you have an idea for a feature or a bug to report, please first open an issue so we can discuss it before actually
making code changes. If you're willing to help, I really wouldn't want you to waste your valuable time.
 
## Code style

There is usually a linter or style checker in my projects, so you should mostly be covered if the build passes.

However, not everything is caught by linters, so please use your best judgement and try to match the existing style
as much as possible.
