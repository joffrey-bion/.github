# Default GitHub Community Files

This repository contains my default GitHub files, such as CONTRIBUTING.md or FUNDING.md, to be used when a repository
 has none.

More information in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file).
